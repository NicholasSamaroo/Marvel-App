# Marvel-App
Exploring the Marvel Comics API via a Java Android mobile application. Users type out the name of a Marvel character in the Edit Text and upon clicking the search button, if the character exists, a Recycler View composed of Card Views is loaded with each variation of the characters thumbnail and name. Upon clicking a card the user is brought to a details page where they can see the characters enlarged thumbnail, description, and a list of comics they are featured in. Retrofit by Square is used for API processing and Picasso by Square is used to load the character thumbnails into ImageViews.
